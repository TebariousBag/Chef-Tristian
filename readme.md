##Overview
The project was to make a website frome scratch based off of the topic Hobbies. And then we were supposed to style it using mainly Bootstrap using as little CSS as possible. And it had to be responsive. A few things had to be included.

SOME OF THESE ARE ON THE SECOND PAGE UNDER THE RECIPE LINK

## Topic
I chose to make a home cooking recipe website. I do like to cook and I find it annoying when I look up a recipe and its just so much filler and ads and I just want to get to the recipe. This is more of a joke where I am posing as a chef with creative recipes of my own. I actually cooked the recipes and made recipe cards and took photos along the way.

I started with a rough sketch idea. and then made a wireframe for it as guidance.

It was more for a general idea, I didn't necessarily stick to it.

##Conclusion
Overall this was a fun project, all the filler content I ended up putting in there was a bit much and took a lot of time. But I learned a lot about Bootstrap along the way.
